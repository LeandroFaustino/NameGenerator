# NameGenerator
This small program is gonna help you generate a fantasy mmorpg name from the name that you input!
The idea of this project was meant to explore a bit more of JavascriptÂ´s functionalities and methods,
together with HTML and CSS, after I concluded my Multimedia course.
The project consists on the user inputing a name, with which the program will split the letters and save
them into an array, then together with some methods it will randomly alter the index where each letter 
is stored altering the order the letters are displayed and printed out.
The visuals were also done to explore what I have learned from my Multimedia course, regarding graphic design and UX UI.
This project features:
  -Front-End with Javascript, CSS, HTML
  -UX UI Design
  -Graphic Design(Adobe Illustrator)
